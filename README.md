### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Rajat Awasthi

Hey there! I'm Rajat Awasthi, a tech enthusiast with a journey that's been nothing short of thrilling. I kickstarted my career with a Bachelor's in Technology from Galgotias University, majoring in Computer Science Engineering. Landing a campus placement from Galgotias University in Wipro set the stage for an incredible ride. Over 2.5 years at Wipro, I dabbled in a myriad of technologies, collaborating closely with HSBC Banking on various projects, including data factory optimization. SQL became second nature to me, while Python and R were my go-to languages for tackling challenges head-on. But life's an adventure, right? So, after soaking up the corporate world for a while, I decided to hit pause and dive into the realm of higher studies. That's when I set my sights on pursuing a Master's in Data Science from the United Kingdom. And here I am now, delving deep into the intricacies of data science and its applications. It's a journey fueled by curiosity, driven by passion, and boundless in its possibilities. Connect with me on LinkedIn, and let's exchange stories and ideas! Cheers to the next chapter! ðŸš€
